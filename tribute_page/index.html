                <p>To the people of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam is no less than an inspiration. People had a great deal of admiration for him 
                    and addressed him as Sir APJ Abdul Kalam. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam’s full name was Avul Pakir Zainuldeben Abdul Kalam, very few people know him by his full name as he was 
                    mostly addressed as ‘Missile Man of India’ and ‘People’s President’. He was born into a very poor family in Rameswaram on 
                    October 15, 1931. </p>
                <p>Since childhood, he enjoyed flying, and was equally curious to know how birds fly in the air? He was very intelligent and 
                    enjoyed reading, but his family did not have sufficient income for his school fees, so to support his education, he would 
                    wake up early in the morning and ride a bicycle 3 kilometres from home to collect newspapers and sell them. </p>
                <p>He was admitted to St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli, and later he went on to complete a degree in physics in 1954 and 
                    then studied at the Madras Institute of Technology and graduated in aeronautical engineering in 1955. Since his childhood, 
                    Dr Abdul Alam wanted to be a pilot but couldn’t make his dream come true. He learned from his mistakes and accomplished 
                    numerous achievements in his life. After completing his degree, Abdul Kalam entered the Defense Department of India. 
                    He has been one of the key figures in building the nuclear capabilities of India.</p>

                <p>In 2002, he was elected President of India and was the country's first scientist and non-political president. He visited 
                    many countries during his tenure as President and led India's youth through his lectures and encouraged them to move forward.  
                    ‘My vision for India’ was a Famous Speech of APJ Abdul Kalam delivered at IIT Hyderabad in 2011, and is to this day my 
                    favourite speech. His far-reaching thinking gave India's growth a fresh path and became the youth's inspiration. 
                    Dr Abdul Kalam died on July 27, 2015, from an apparent cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong at the age 
                    of 83. He spent his entire life in service and inspiration for the nation and the youth, and his death is also while 
                    addressing the youth. His death is a never-ending loss to the country.</p>
